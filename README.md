# homeRoughEditor Version 0.94

Help me to make this project an essential and free resource for all, so that any developer / integrator can propose to create **_plans for house_, _apartment_**, etc. online. **Full Javascript**, No external library without an old Jquery (only for Bootstrap), Boostrap 3 and FontAwesome.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Installing

You just have to copy the files into a directory and open the index.html file in your browser.

### See example
![homeRoughEditor](/res/example_room.png?raw=true)

## Running the tests

Personally I only test all this with the Safari debug console

## TODO
- Make TouchScreen functions for tablet (or smartphone, but screen is a bit too tiny perhaps...)
- Browser interoperability
- Refine the CSS and buttons behavior
- Refine the Historical system (use LocalStorage)
- Make your own system/functions to export plan to any database 
- Export to a file format readable by Three.js and Blender

## Built With

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) - My code editor. Simple and free.
* [Bootstrap](getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/) - Bootstrap, a sleek, intuitive, and powerful mobile first front-end framework for faster and easier web development.
* [SVG Path editor](https://yqnn.github.io/svg-path-editor/) - some SVG symbols have been drafted thanks to this tool
